Hangman

A JavaScript Practice Project

This project is a simple Hangman game created using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.
It was built as a learning exercise to improve JavaScript programming skills, DOM manipulation, and basic game logic.

🎮 How the Game Works

The game uses the full alphabet A–Z.

The player guesses letters to reveal the hidden word.

Each incorrect guess adds 1 mistake.

If the user makes a form mistake (like submitting an empty or invalid character), a notification bubble appears to warn them.

After 8 mistakes, another bubble appears informing the player that they reached the limit, and the game is lost.

If the player guesses the word before reaching 8 mistakes, the game displays a message showing that the player won, and the game ends.
